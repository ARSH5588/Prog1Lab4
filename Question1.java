/*Write a program that receives a word as an input
*from the user and checks if it is a palindrome: if it
*reads the same backward as forward. A few examples are
*"civic", "radar" and "level". To make your program more
*advanced, ignore punctuation, capitalization, and spaces,
*and recognize sentences as "A man, a plan, a canal - Panama",
"Murder for a jar of red rum" and "Madam, Iâ€™m Adam".*/
